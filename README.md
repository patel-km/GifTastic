Utilizing APIs and ajax to pull gifs from GIPHY.

To the user: See hilarious gifs at the click of a button! Click a button to see gifs based on the button's title (ex: dog, cat, happy, funny) or type in what you want to see and make a new button! 


To developers: 
This web application displays a variety of buttons, an input field for users to add their own buttons, and space for gifs. 

Once a user clicks on a button, it will pull relevant gifs from GIPHY.com and load them on the screen. The relevancy of gifs to a button is based on the keywords attached to that button.
